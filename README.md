a Web Development Project

<h1 align="center">Welcome to Clementine</h1>
<h3 align="left">Project Description:</h3>
<p>We developed a fully responsive website for a luxury jewelry brand under the name of Clementine (https://www.clementine.website/) 
which sells specifically diamond and gold, catered towards women around the age of 18-45. Our website offers a seamless shopping experience for customers, and facilitated management for admins.</p>

<h3 align="left">Our Goals:</h3>
<p> We wanted to deliver a nicely done website that satisifies all the requirements for our team project while ensuring that our knowledge on web development is expanding. </p>

<p>Our website ensures that the products are displayed in a sophisticated matter, while also maintaining eye-catching features. Keeping the user experience in mind by easing up the navigation through the website was also a priority, using a sophisticated and minimalist design and allowing the website to be responsive to different screen ratios</p>
<p>This project will hopefully act as a guideline to any of us( the contributors ) if we needed to develop a website in the future</p>

<h3 align="left">Our Features:</h3>
<h4> Sophisticated Product Display: </h4> <p> We ensured that the products are displayed in a sophisticated manner, with high-quality images and detailed product descriptions. This helps customers make informed decisions while shopping and to draw the user's attention and make the website more engaging. Our products pages are all paginated and have a sorting feature to satisfy the user's experience. </p>

<h4> User Authentication: </h4> <p> We included user authentication functionality, allowing customers to create accounts and log in to access their order history, saved items, carts and other personalized features. We verify every logged in user to make sure the process is secure. We also allow users who forgot their passwords to reset them by mail as well. </p>


<h4>Search bar functionality: </h4> <p> We implemented a search bar that allows customers to quickly find the product they are looking for using AJAX. This helps to save time and makes the shopping experience more efficient. We also integrated sorting features to make the customer as satisfied as possbile.</p>

<h4>Communication: </h4> <p> To make the customer as satisfied as possible, we offer many ways of communication. Through the usr profile panel, the user can easily chat with out chatGBT chatbot that is well trained to answer and handle customer's inquiries. We also offer communication by mail through the contact us page. We integrated nodemailer and MailGun APIs to make sure the process is smooth and th customers' concerns are delivered. Last but not least, as we care about our customers' feedback on our products, we allow the customers to leave their reviews and ratings in the product's details page.</p>


<h4> Easy Checkout Process: </h4> <p> We included a simple, validated and easy checkout process that allows customers to complete their purchase quickly and efficiently. Once the order is placed successfully the user recieves a confirmation mail, and is regularly updated  with their orders' status updates through email to assure them. </p>

<h4> Responsive Design and animations: </h4> <p> We want to serve the best user exprience we could, so we made sure that the website is responsive to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring that all users can access the website regardless of their device while maintaining eye catching features. </p>

<h4> Admin Dashboard: </h4> <p> We created an admin dashboard that allows admins to manage products, orders, and customers. They can seamlessly edit, delete, create and search for products. Our search functionality is smooth and seemless, as the admin can search based off their needs; one admin may want to search the products based off availability or ID, another may want to search the orders based off their status, etc.. We ensured to cover it all. We also added a reviews page to display and track the incoming reviews from users. This makes it easy for them to keep track of inventory, process orders, and handle customer inquiries </p>

<h4> User Profile: </h4> <p> We facilitated the shopping experience to the customer by allowing them to edit their profiles' settings; such as passwords, addresses and many more. They can also track their orders process, and also add products to wishlist and remove them however he likes. </p>

<h4> Team Collaboration: </h4> <p> We worked collaboratively as a team, communicating effectively to ensure that all elements of the website work together seamlessly. </p>
