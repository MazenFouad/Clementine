# Web-Development-Project

<h1 align="center">Welcome to our group project</h1>
<h3 align="left">Project Description:</h3>
<p>We developed a website for a luxury jewelry brand under the name of Clementine ((https://www.clementine.website/)) 
which sells specifically diamond and gold, catered towards women around the age of 18-45</p>

<h3 align="left">Our Goals:</h3>
<p> We wanted to deliver a nicely done website that satisifies all the requirements for our team project while ensuring that our knowledge on web development is expanding. </p>
<p>Our website ensures that the products are displayed in a sophisticated matter, while also maintaining eye-catching features. We ensured to facilitate the experience to both clients and admins dynamically so 
they hopefully face no troubles. Keeping the user experience in mind by easing up the navigation through the website was also a priority, using a sophisticated and minimalist design and allowing the website to be responsive to different screen ratios</p>
<p>This project will hopefully act as a guideline to any of us( the contributors ) if we needed to develop a website in the future</p>
